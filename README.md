A trivia game using JavaScript and jQuery.

# What the project does?
The game loops through questions that are stored in an array and the user has a certain amount of time to answer before the game ends.

# Why is the project useful?
The game demonstrates a use of JavaScript, jQuery, and timers.

# How is the game played?
The player hits the "Let's go!" button and the questions and timer load. The player then selects an answer to each of the questions before the timer runs out. If all of the questions are answered before the time runs out, the player is presented a score. If the player does not answer all of the questions before the time runs out, the question page disappears and the player is presented a score.
